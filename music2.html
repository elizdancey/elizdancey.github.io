                    <h3>Everlong by Foo Fighters</h3>
                    <p>The first time I remember really connecting with this song was when I was driving with my friend Clare. It was fall time and the leaves were just changing colors. The first guitar chord dropped after the main riff played out for awhile and I was hooked. The combination of the weather I was experiencing and the nostalgic sounds makes this song perfect. </p>

                    <h3>Easy by Commodores</h3>
                    <p>This song always reminds me of my mom since it is also one of her favorite songs. I have memories of her singing it even from when I was younger. The jazzy piano and vocals that continues throughout the entire song makes it an addicting listen.</p>

                    <h3>Stand Inside Your Love by The Smashing Pumpkins</h3>
                    <p>This is another song that my friend Clare and I fell in love with. Her are big Smashing Pumpkins fans and we share this as our favorite song by them. I think it became solidified as my favorite when Clare and I got to see it live with each other. I love how the song builds in intensity as it progresses.</p>
