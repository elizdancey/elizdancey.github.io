                    <p>Welcome to my webpage! This page was made in my Web Development class in my first year attending here at Madonna University. The class was web based, and only was taught online. This was my second online class involving computer science components, so things were still a little tricky. <p>
                    <p>Even with the ups and downs of this course, I still feel I was able to pull away with a good amount of knowledge that I can take away to future projects. I hope you enjoy my website!</p>

                    <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
                    <p>My name is Elizabeth Dancey and I am currently finishing up my freshman year at Madonna University. My current plan of study is to get a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Graphic Design, or wirh a certificate in Cyber Security. I have a lot to learn when it comes to Computer Science, but I am interested and ready to learn more about the concept. The main reason why I came to Madonna is to be a member of both the track and cross country team, so running is a huge part of my life. I am very grateful to have a sport that I love, be able to pay for my education. <p>
